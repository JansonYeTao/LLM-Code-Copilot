# LLM Code Copilot



This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) through endpoints. The implementation leverages llama.cpp for model inference and ngrok for secure tunneling, allowing you to easily access and interact with the model from any location with colab fee gpu.

## Model Used
The base Jupyter Notebook is designed to work with the zephyr-7b model from TheBloke. This model provides a robust framework for exploring the capabilities of LLMs in a user-friendly environment.

## Features
- Endpoint Integration: Seamlessly connect to LLM endpoints for real-time interactions (NoteL using colab notebook for set up rest service is not ok on production environments. This is purely for education purpose.).
- Model Flexibility: Easily swap in different models as needed.
- VSCode Extension: Includes a Visual Studio Code extension to offer copilot experience.


## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Launch the Jupyter Notebook and start code generation endpoint
